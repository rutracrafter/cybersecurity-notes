The [[OSI Model]] is a popular model for learning the theory behind computer networking. In reality, the more compact [[TCP-IP Model]] is more closely related to what is actually used in the real world.

[[Encapsulation]] allows for a standardized way of sending and receiving data and it is the name of the proccess by which the data that goes through the OSI Model gets more information added to it based on what that specific layer is responsible for in the OSI Model.

As previously mentioned, the [[TCP-IP Model]] is used as a basis for real-world networking, also note that it is a few years older than the OSI Model.

The TCP-IP Model and OSI Model were originally created to establish a standard that manufacturers were required to adhere to in order to make devices from different manufacturers, running different operating systems and different software to be able to communicate with one another via the wonders of networking. The TCP-IP Model remains the standard that is in use today, and the OSI Model also remains a great educational tool to learn more about networking.

The following are some basic networking tools:
- `ping` - this is a tool used to send a ping to a remote target via the ICMP protocol which operates on the Network layer of the OSI Model and the Internet layer of the TCP-IP Model. Ping can also be used to determine the IP address of a host.
- `traceroute` - this is a tool that allows us to see the jump/hops (the intermediate steps) that our connection went through to connect to the target/host.
- `whois` - this is a tool that allows you to query a who a domain is registered to and can offer a great deal of information about who has leased out that domain! Note that in Europe personal details are redacted, however, in most other places there can be a ton of information gathered from a whois search.
